          <h1>About:</h1>  
            <p id="about"> The school was originally established as 'Miss Prescott's Fort Christian School' by an English woman in 1865, thanks to donations from city philanthropists like the distinguished Premchand Roychand. It was later renamed the 'Frere Fletcher School'. In 1965 the school was sought to be merged with the Cathedral Girls School when Mr. Jehangir Bomanji Petit took over the schools administration. Although established and run by members of the Zoroastrian community, Mr. Petit wanted to ensure that the school maintained its cosmopolitan and diverse character. The 'J. B. Petit High School for Girls' as it came to be called after its savior, still maintains this cosmopolitan nature today. In 1973, the school came under the leadership of principal Shirin Darasha who brought to the school a zeal for drama and the arts that is still prevalent today as well as progressive ideas and methods of education.</p></div></section>
